I'm here to help you easily remove the background from your images. Simply send me a photo, and I'll work my magic! âœ¨

Here's how it works:
1. Send me a photo with a clear subject you want to keep.
2. Wait a moment while I process the image.
3. VoilÃ ! I'll send you back the image with the background removed.

Please keep in mind:
- For best results, use high-resolution images with a distinct subject.
- I don't store or share any of your images.

Feel free to give it a try! Send me an image and let's get started. If you have any questions, just type 'help'.

Enjoy using the Background Remover Bot! ðŸ“¸âœ¨
